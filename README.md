# Teatotal

If you've ever made the mistake of leaving your teabag in so short that it tastes like badly-flavoured water, or too long so you get a horribly stewed nightmare, you are not alone. 

Or what about when you've been somewhere outside of home and there's a strange and scary tea brand you don't know very well? How long should you steep?

Teatotal is the app for tea lovers to avoid these horrors and make sure they get their tea just right.
